- stateful generators: f(state) -> number
    - how to go about nd-generators?
- discrete filters: f(...) -> boolean
    - implemented with mask
    - optional shrinking on proceed
- continuous filters: f(...) -> number
    - adjusts the positions of border elements
    - filters at 0+0
- cuts: f(...) -> number
    - cut edge if ends have different sign (0 is negative)
- glue points together
    - I have no idea of how to go about it
- 0+0 is to support booleans
- polyline optimization
- mesh optimization
- nd generators
- prepared map / each
